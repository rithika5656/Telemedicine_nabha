Telemedicine Access for Rural Healthcare in Nabha
# Description	
# Problem Description

Nabha and its surrounding rural areas face significant healthcare challenges. The local Civil Hospital operates at less than 50% staff capacity, with only 11 doctors for 23 sanctioned posts. Patients from 173 villages travel long distances, often missing work, only to find that specialists are unavailable or medicines are out of stock. Poor road conditions and sanitation further hinder access. Many residents lack timely medical care, leading to worsened health outcomes and increased financial strain.

# Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

This problem directly affects the health and livelihood of thousands of rural residents, especially daily-wage earners and farmers. Lack of accessible healthcare leads to preventable complications, financial losses, and overall decline in community well-being. Addressing this issue would improve healthcare delivery, reduce unnecessary travel, and enhance quality of life for a large, underserved population.
